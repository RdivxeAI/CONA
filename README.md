# CONA: AI Without Training

**CONA (Compute Neural Architecture)** represents a paradigm shift in artificial intelligence, introducing a framework that transforms any dataset directly into a fully functional neural network model—without the need for conventional iterative training or extensive computational resources. By leveraging advanced data-to-model translation mechanisms, CONA produces AI models that exhibit performance comparable to traditionally trained networks, while drastically reducing training time and resource consumption.

This framework provides a foundational approach for future AI systems that require rapid deployment across diverse datasets, redefining efficiency and scalability in neural computation.
